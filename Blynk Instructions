#Blynk App Instructions

1) Download the Blynk app on your mobile device and setup your account. 

2) Create a new app, adding an ESP32 Dev Board as a device. 

3) Generate an auth token and put that token in the appropriate spot in the CoopCam code (line 26, char auth[] = "xxxxxx";  //sent by Blynk)

4) Add a "simple button" - Named  "Open Door" or similar. Output is V7 and configured as a push button. style choices are up to you. 

5) Repeat step 4, but name it "Close Door" and output is V6.

6) Make 4 LEDs, named "Door Open, Door Closed, Door Opening, Door Closing", set the colours as you want (I went with Open - RED, Closed - GREEN, Opening/Closing - Amber.

7) Set the inputs for the LEDs. Door Open input V1, Door Closed input V2, Door Opening input V3, Door Closing input V4.

8) Make another simple button, name it Camera, or something similar. V5 as output. I like to add an "off label" of "Take Photo" so the button says what it is going to do. 

9) Make an Image Gallery with V0 as input.

You are ready to rock!
