# IMPORTANT NOTES FOR PROGRAMMING

Neither the main board, or the CoopCam wifi board, have on-board USB-TTL serial converters. In order to program, or view the serial monitor you will need a programming adapter. 
I've been using a CH340G based board for the ATMEGA328P and an FTDI based programming board for the ESP32-CAM.

# Programming Process:

# ATMEGA328P:

-Open CoopCommandWifiRev1 in Arduino IDE.

-Select proper board (Arduino Nano is used in this case).

-Disconnect CoopCam and Power Connectors (programmer provides power to target).

-Connect CH340G programmer in the following way: 5v-5v, GND-GND, TX-RX, RX-TX.

-Plug programmer into USB and select proper port in Arduino IDE.

-Hold down reset button while clicking "upload". Hold button down until IDE says "uploading".

-Release reset button, program will upload and IDE will confirm with "upload complete". 

-Disconnect programmer from CoopCommand Board.

-Reconnect CoopCam.

-Reconnect Power.


# ESP32-CAM:

-Open CoopCamTest2_BlynkEmail in Arduino IDE

-Select proper board (AI-THINKER ESP32-CAM).

-Disconnect CoopCam from CoopCommand main board.

-Connect FTDI programmer to programming header: 5v-5v, GND-GND, TX-RX, RX-TX.

-Hold down "flash" button while plugging programmer into USB port. Continue to hold down "flash" button.

-Select proper port in Arduino IDE.

-Click Upload. Once sketch has been compiled and has begun uploading to ESP32-CAM you can release the flash button. 

-Once programming is complete, press reset button on ESP32-CAM.

-Disconnect programmer. 

-Connect CoopCam to CoopCommand main board.
